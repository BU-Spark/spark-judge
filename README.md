# Hackathon Judging Platform

This is a project built with [Chef](https://chef.convex.dev) using [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.
You can find docs about Chef with useful information like how to deploy to production [here](https://docs.convex.dev/chef).

## Project structure

The frontend code is in the `app` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

The backend code is in the `convex` directory.

`npm run dev` will start the frontend and backend servers.

## App authentication

Chef apps use [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/).

## HTTP API

User-defined http routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts`.
